# Visibility Polygon

Visibility Polygon is a Node.js website designed to illustrate the visibility of a simple polygon from an inner point.

## Installation

To install, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the git repository
2. Install Node.js and C++ dependencies
3. Run
```
npm install
npm run start
```
4. Go to localhost:3000

## Features

- Add node: On the left side bar, click on the "Node" button and then click on the white canva to place a node.
- Add line: Click on the "Line" button, then select two nodes to connect them by a line.
- Move node: Click on an existing node and move the cursor while holding left mouse button.
- Delete items: Click on the "Delete" button, then select the node / line to delete.
- Place an observer: same with adding a node. The observer can't move so you need to repeat this action to change its position.
- Display the result: Click on the "Submit" button, if the observer is inside a simple polygon, then a yellow region is drawn as the visibility region. Make sure only no redundant node exists.
